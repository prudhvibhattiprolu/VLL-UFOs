# Model files for vectorlike leptons

This repository has FeynRules and Universal FeynRules Output (UFO) model files for vectorlike leptons along with template scripts to compute cross-sections at LO or NLO (in QCD).

## Files  
**FeynRules model files in `FeynRulesfiles` folder:**

Doublet VLL model: `VLLD.fr`

Singlet VLL model: `VLLS.fr`

UFO (Universal FeynRules Output) files can be generated by running FeynRulesfiles/*.nb Mathematica notebook files. (Edit the paths to FeynRules, FeynArts and NLOCT packages before running .nb files.)

**UFO model files in `UFOmodels` folder (generated using FeynRules, MadGraph-compatible):**

Doublet VLL model: `VLLD_NLO`

Singlet VLL model: `VLLS_NLO`

## Importing UFO model file into MadGraph:

**Before importing into MadGraph, the UFO model files should be moved to `<path to MadGraph>/models/`**

The model files are compatible with Madgraph version v2 that was built on python2, but should also work with the latest Madgraph v3 that uses python3. In order to use Madgraph v3, these model files can be made compatible with python3 by doing :

```cXYZ = VLLD_NLO or VLLS_NLO
MG5_aMC> set auto_convert_model T
```

before importing the model file into Madgraph:

```cXYZ = VLLD_NLO or VLLS_NLO
MG5_aMC> import model XYZ
```
**XYZ = `VLLD_NLO` or `VLLS_NLO`**

## Model information

In these VLL models,

#### Particles:

`taup` : charged VLL (in both models)
`taup~` : its anti-particle

`nup` : neutral VLL (only in VLLD_NLO)
`nup~` : its anti-particle

#### Masses:

`MTAUP` : mass of taup particle
`MNUP` : mass of nup particle

#### Widths:
`WTAUP` : width of taup
`WNUP` : width of nup

**Note: These widths are set to 1 GeV. This should not matter if one forces the decay of these particles while generating events (see below).**

## Pair-production of VLLs

### Computing cross-sections at LO using Madgraph:

#### Doublet VLL

**For p p -> taup taup:**

    MG5_aMC> generate p p > taup taup~

**For p p -> taup nup:**

    MG5_aMC> generate p p > taup nup~
    MG5_aMC> add process p p > taup~ nup

**For p p -> nup nup:**

    MG5_aMC> generate p p > nup nup~

#### Singlet VLL

**For p p -> taup taup:**

    MG5_aMC> generate p p > taup taup~

#### Running MADGRAPH from a script to compute cross-sections:

One can calculate cross-sections using MADGRAPH from a script by doing:

    $ <path to MADGRAPH>/bin/mg5_aMC script

Below is an example MadGraph-script to calculate LO production cross-section for p p > taup nup, at 13 TeV LHC, in the Doublet VLL model for MTAUP = MNUP = 100, 200, 300, .., 1000 GeV using MSTW2008nlo68cl PDFs (lhaid: 21100) with factorization scale = 200 GeV.

    ###script###
    import model VLLD_NLO
    generate p p > taup nup~
    add process p p > taup~ nup
    output dvll_tpnp
    launch dvll_tpnp
    shower=off
    detector=off
    analysis=off
    done
    #set iseed=1000
    set nevents 10000
    set ebeam1 6500
    set ebeam2 6500
    #CHANGE SCALES HERE
    set fixed_ren_scale=True
    set fixed_fac_scale=True
    set scale=200
    set dsqrt_q2fact1=200
    set dsqrt_q2fact2=200
    #CHANGE PDF SET HERE
    set pdlabel = lhapdf
    set lhaid = 21100
    #SYNCHRONIZED SCAN OVER MULTIPLE PARAMETERS CAN BE DONE USING *_scan1_* (INSTEAD OF *_scan_*)
    set mtaup scan1:range(100,1100,100)
    set mnup scan1:range(100,1100,100)
    done

**Note: By default MadGraph sets `fixed_ren_scale` and `fixed_fac_scale` to `False` (i.e. *dynamic* scale choice). They should be set to `True` to use *fixed* scales.**

**Also, by default MadGraph sets `pdlabel` to `nn23lo1` (MadGraph's default PDFs based on NNPDF2.3 set) for LO calculations. `pdlabel` should be set to `lhapdf` to gain access to many other PDFs with `lhaid` listed in https://lhapdf.hepforge.org/pdfsets.html**

#### Template scripts to compute cross-sections in `TemplateScripts/Madgraph-CrossSections` folder:

##### File names:

`dvll_*`: Doublet VLL model

`svll_*`: Singlet VLL model

`*_lo`: LO cross-sections

`*_nlo`: NLO cross-sections

`*_tptp_*`: p p -> taup taup

`*_npnp_*`: p p -> nup nup (only in Doublet VLL)

`*_tpnp_*`: p p -> taup nup (only in Doublet VLL)

`*_total_*`: Total pair production cross-section

##### Replace the following in each script using sed/awk/by-hand before executing it:

`@@OUTPUT@@`: Folder name created by Madgraph

`@@NEVENTS@@`: Number of generated events in each run

`@@ENERGY@@`: Beam energy in GeV

`@@FIXEDSCALE@@`: Set this to `True` to use fixed scale or `False` to use Madgraph's default dynamic scale choice

`@@SCALE@@`: Scale choice in GeV if `@@FIXEDSCALE@@` is set to `True` 

`@@MASS@@`: Mass of taup (= Mass of nup in Doublet VLL) in GeV



 (The folder `CrossSections` has the VLL pair-production cross-sections computed at both LO and NLO (in QCD) at 13 TeV LHC using Madgraph’s default PDFs (different for LO and NLO calculations as mentioned in the files) and default dynamic scale for masses M = 100 to 1000 GeV in steps of 10 GeV for LO and 5 GeV for NLO.)

## Other models where VLLs mix with e or mu

By default, in the model files, the VLLs are assumed to mix only with the taus. But, VLLs can also be made to mix only with e or mu by changing the relevant couplings (`gtaup*` and `gnup*`”) in the couplings block of “param_card.dat” (while running Madgraph interactively or through a script). For VLLs mixing only with muons, for example, set:

#### in doublet VLL model:

(relevant for decay of tau prime to Z and e, mu, or tau)

```
gtaupeRz = 0

gtaupmuRz = 0.1

gtauptaRz = 0
```

(relevant for decay of tau prime to Higgs and e, mu, or tau)

```
gtaupeRh = 0

gtaupmuRh = 0.1

gtauptaRh = 0
```

(relevant for decay of nu prime to W and e, mu, or tau)

```
gnupeRw = 0

gnupmRw = 0.1

gnuptRw = 0
```

#### And, in the singlet VLL model:

(relevant for decay of tau prime to W and ve, vmu, or vtau)

```
gtaupveLw = 0

gtaupvmLw = 0.1

gtaupvtLw = 0
```

(relevant for decay of tau prime to Z and e, mu, or tau)

```
gtaupeLz = 0

gtaupmuLz = 0.1

gtauptaLz = 0
```

(relevant for decay of tau prime to Higgs and e, mu, or tau)

```
gtaupeLh  = 0

gtaupmuLh = 0.1

gtauptaLh = 0
```

**Note: The value `0.1` for the couplings `gtaup*` and `gnup*` is not physically relevant (except that it is non-zero) while generating signal events since in the analysis the VLL pair-production cross-sections are multiplied by the appropriate branching ratios of the VLL.**
